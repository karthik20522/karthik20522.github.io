<h1>Micro Frameworks - Http - ORM</h1>
<p>Dec, 2013</p>
            Not sure if you guys are keeping track of non-Microsoft based programming like node.js, but the new trend seems to be event driven programming. In .net world it's basically asynchronous programming. There were two articles that I came across recently, one was <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2011/03/7000-concurrent-connections-with.html">asynchronous wcf</a> &amp; other being <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2010/11/using-task-parallel-library-with-aspnet.html">asynchronous asp.net mvc</a>
<br />
<br />There has been a lot of buzz around http micro-frameworks in .NET world namely OWIN (Open web interface in .NET). First came Kayak [<a href="http://kayakhttp.com/">http://kayakhttp.com</a>] and then came Nancy [<a href="https://github.com/thecodejunkie/Nancy">https://github.com/thecodejunkie/Nancy</a>], Nina [<a href="http://jondot.github.com/nina">http://jondot.github.com/nina</a>], ManosDeMono [<a href="http://manosdemono.org/">http://manosdemono.org</a>] and many more [<a href="http://owin.org/#projects">http://owin.org/#projects</a>]. All of these basically is one or more variation of Sinatra [ruby - <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">http://www.sinatrarb.com</a>]. Nina seems to be pretty cool, as they have support for different View Engines (Spark, django, Razor,haml). KayakHttp is a standalone server making it independent of IIS. My experience with Kayak has been quite pleasantful but you do need to remember it's a event driven programming model.

<br />But like http micro-frameworks there are quite a buzz around micro-ORM too. Frameworks like Dapper.NET [<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net">http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net</a>] and Simple.Data [<a href="https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data">https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data</a>] are gaining a lot of traction. Simple.Data is quite a framework for it's ability of plugin interface.
