            "Event Viewer" is an yet another attempt to visualize images similar to my <a href="http://kufli.blogspot.com/2012/11/research-timeline-how-did-i-build-this.html">{re}Search Timeline</a> project.

            The whole point of this proof-of-concept project is to visualize the images from the perspective of the events rather than just displaying an grid of images. For example, a search on GettyImages.com website basically displays a list of images in a tabular fashion which provides no sense of association between individual images being displayed. But having them grouped together as part of an event provides a sense of association and correlation between images.

<br><br>
            Displaying images is always a tricky business. A dominant color filter technique could probably provide an alternate way of scanning thru images as user might be more interested in images of particular color than the fine details of an image.

            From a technology standpoint for building this project was nothing special.
<ul>
    <li>ASP.NET MVC 4 - Razor</li>
    <li>Amazon SQS - for event scrapping from GettyImages</li>
    <li>Connect API for event and image detail lookup</li>
    <li>MongoDB</li>

</ul>
