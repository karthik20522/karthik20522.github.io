Before we get into spray, would recommend reading different ways of Versioning an API or best practices of versioning an API at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/389169/best-practices-for-api-versioning">best-practices-for-api-versioning</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10742594/versioning-rest-api">versioning-rest-api</a>.

<br><br>

To summarize the stackoverflow discussion, there are 3 ways to do versioning.
<ul>
    <li>Header based - using X-API-Version</li>
    <li>URL based - http://{uri}/v1/getCustomer</li>
    <li>Content negotiation via Accept headers - application/vnd.example.v1+json (mediatype)</li>
</ul>

For this tutorial, I would be implementing the first two.<br><br>

<b>1) Header based - using X-API-Version</b>
Here I am building a Directive that extracts the version from the request header. If not exists than I am defaulting to 1

<pre>
    trait VersionDirectives {
      val extractVersion: Directive[String :: HNil] =
        extract { ctx =>
          val header = ctx.request.headers.find(_.name == "X-API-Version")
          header match {
            case Some(head) => head.value
            case _          => "1" //default to 1
          }
        }

      def versioning: Directive[String :: HNil] =
        extractVersion.flatMap { v =>
          provide(v)
        }
    }
</pre>

In the above code there are two keywords, "extract" and "provide". These are part of Sprays BasicDirective. "extract" basically allows you to extract a single value and "provides" allows you to inject a value into the Directive. But wait, we can make this trait even smaller by getting rid of the provide all together to something as follows:
<pre>
trait VersionDirectives {
  def versioning: Directive[String :: HNil] =
    extract { ctx =>
      val header = ctx.request.headers.find(_.name == "X-API-Version")
      header match {
        case Some(head) => head.value
        case _          => "1" //default to 1
      }
    }
}

</pre>
<i>Note: there are more than one way to write same operation in scala/spray. bane of my existence!</i>

<br><br>
Now that we have defined the directive, we just need to inherit the directive to service trait and call versioning to extract the version number from X-API-Version header field.

<pre>
    trait CustomerService extends HttpService with Json4sSupport with VersionDirectives {

    val customerRoutes = {
    path("getCustomer" / Segment) { customerId =>
    get {
    versioning { v =>
    println(v)
    //do something now that you have extracted the version number
    . . . .
</pre>

<b>2) url based - http://{uri}/v1/getCustomer</b>
<br>

Here we are basically performing regex on the incoming request.uri and extracting the version out of "v*". Spray provides quite a few PathFilters and one of them being PathMatcher. More info at:<br>

</ul>


<pre>
trait CustomerService extends HttpService with Json4sSupport {

  val Version = PathMatcher("""v([0-9]+)""".r)
    .flatMap {
      case vString :: HNil => {
        try Some(Integer.parseInt(vString) :: HNil)
        catch {
          case _: NumberFormatException =>
            Some(1 :: HNil) //default to version 1
        }
      }
    }

  val customerRoutes =
    pathPrefix(Version) { apiVersion =>
      {
        //. . . .
        path("getCustomer" / Segment) { customerId =>
          get {
            complete {
              apiVersion match {
                case 1 => {
                  // do something if version 1
                }
                case 2 => ??? //do something if version 2
                case _ => {
                  //do something if any other version
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
