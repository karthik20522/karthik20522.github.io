"Directives" are small building blocks of which you can construct arbitrarily complex route structures. A directive does one or more of the following:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Transform the incoming RequestContext before passing it on to its inner route</li>
    <li>Filter the RequestContext according to some logic, i.e. only pass on certain requests and reject all others</li>
    <li>Apply some logic to the incoming RequestContext and create objects that are made available to inner routes as "extractions"</li>
    <li>Complete the request</li>
</ul>

More detailed information on directives can be found at <a href="http://spray.io/documentation/1.2-M8/">http://spray.io/documentation/1.2-M8/</a> or here <a href="http://spray.io/documentation/1.2-M8/spray-routing/predefined-directives-alphabetically/">Spray-routing/predefined-directives-alphabetically/</a>. In future examples, I would be using Directives so basic understanding would be useful. For this example I would be using Authentication directive to validate the request with a username and password as part of the header.

<br><br>

So, for authentication a new UserAuthentication trait is created which has a function that returns a ContextAuthenticator. The authenticate directive expects either a ContextAuthenticator or a Future[Authenication[T]]. At the crust of ContextAuthenticator is basically Future[Authenication[T]].
<br><br>
Below code that describes the authentication directive basically takes in a ContextAuthenticator and returns a Future of Authentication type of Either Rejection or an Object of type T. What this means is that Either a Rejection is returned (Left) like FailedAuthenticationRejection when credentials are missing or failed; or when successful an object is returned (Right)
<br>
<pre>
    package object authentication {
        type ContextAuthenticator[T] = RequestContext => Future[Authentication[T]]
        type Authentication[T] = Either[Rejection, T]
        //. . . .
    }
</pre>

<br>

The UserAuthentication trait has two functions, one that returns a ContextAuthentication and other that returns a Future. In this example, I am reading the username and password from the application.conf file and validating against it.<br>

<pre>
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import spray.routing.AuthenticationFailedRejection

case class User(userName: String, token: String) {}

trait UserAuthentication {

  val conf = ConfigFactory.load()
  lazy val configusername = conf.getString("security.username")
  lazy val configpassword = conf.getString("security.password")

  def authenticateUser: ContextAuthenticator[User] = { ctx =>
    {
      //get username and password from the url
      val usr = ctx.request.uri.query.get("usr").get
      val pwd = ctx.request.uri.query.get("pwd").get

      doAuth(usr, pwd)
    }
  }

  private def doAuth(
      userName: String,
      password: String
  ): Future[Authentication[User]] = {
    //here you can call database or a web service to authenticate the user
    Future {
      Either.cond(
        password == configpassword && userName == configusername,
        User(userName = userName, token = java.util.UUID.randomUUID.toString),
        AuthenticationFailedRejection("CredentialsRejected")
      )
    }
  }
}

</pre>

<i>Note that I am importing "scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global", this is because futures require an ExecutionContext and I letting spray to use the default actor ExecutingContext. //implicit val system = ActorSystem("on-spray-can")</i>
<br>
<br>

Now that we have the authentication setup, we need to inherit the UserAuthenticationTrait using "with" and use the "authentication" directive by passing the "authenticateUser" function that we defined.
<br>
<pre>
trait CustomerService
    extends HttpService
    with Json4sSupport
    with UserAuthentication {

  val customerRoutes =
    path("addCustomer") {
      post {
        authenticate(authenticateUser) { user =>
          entity(as[JObject]) { customerObj =>
            complete {
              //. . . .
            }
          }
        }
      }
    } ~
      path("getCustomer" / Segment) { customerId =>
        get {
          authenticate(authenticateUser) { user =>
            {
              complete {
                //. . .
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
}

    [Success GET] http://localhost:8080/getCustomer/520ed44941f19472d5f?usr=karthik&pwd=kufli
    [Failed GET] http://localhost:8080/getCustomer/520ed44941f19472d5f9?usr=fail&pwd=wrong
</pre>
