For a REST based interface, JSON request and response is the norm. There are two ways to set the response format in Spray. <br><br>
1) <b>using respondWithMediaType</b>


<pre>
get {
  respondWithMediaType(`application/json`) {
    complete {
      //Some object response
    }
  }
}

</pre>

In this method, each route/action would have to be explicitly set with media type of json. More info at <a href="https://github.com/spray/spray/wiki/Misc-Directives">https://github.com/spray/spray/wiki/Misc-Directives</a>
<br><br>
2) <b>Globally overriding the default format. </b>
<br><br>
For all Json related operations, I am using Json4s as the json library. In the build.scala add the following json4s dependency.

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java">
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    . . . . .
    "org.json4s"    %% "json4s-native"   % "3.2.4"
    )
</script>
<i>Note: you would need to reload the project in sbt and regenerate Eclipse. Eclipse does not refresh itself when new dependencies are added</i>
<br><br>
In the CustomerServiceActor we will need to set the default Format to json4sFormats by adding the implicit formatter

    <pre>

    import spray.httpx.Json4sSupport
    import org.json4s.Formats
    import org.json4s.DefaultFormats
    import com.example.model.Customer

    class CustomerServiceActor extends Actor with CustomerService with AjaxService {
    implicit def json4sFormats: Formats = DefaultFormats
    . . . .
</pre>

For example purpose, lets update the getCutomer action to return a mocked customer. The expected response should be a json formatted customer object.
<pre>
path("getCustomer" / Segment) { customerId =>
  get {
    complete {
      val customer = Customer(
        id = Some(customerId),
        firstName = "Karthik",
        lastName = "Srinivasan"
      )
      customer //return customer obj
    }
  }
}

/*
[GET] http://localhost:8080/getCustomer/123
[Response] {"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"S","id":"123", "city":"New York","country":"USA"}
*/
</pre>
<pre>
    //The customer case class is as follows:
    package com.example.model

case class Customer(
    firstName: String,
    lastName: String,
    id: Option[String] = None,
    phoneNumber: Option[String] = None,
    address: Option[String] = None,
    city: Option[String] = Some("New York"),
    country: Option[String] = Some("USA"),
    zipcode: Option[String] = None
) {}

</pre>
<br>
To post a customer object and deserialize it to customer type, we can use spray entity [<a href="http://spray.io/documentation/1.1-M8/spray-httpx/unmarshalling/">http://spray.io/documentation/1.1-M8/spray-httpx/unmarshalling/</a>] and cast the post value to a JObject

<pre>
import org.json4s.JsonAST.JObject

path("addCustomer") {
  post {
    entity(as[JObject]) { customerObj =>
      complete {
        val customer = customerObj.extract[Customer]
        //insert customer information into a DB and return back customer obj
        customer
      }
    }
  }
}

/*
[POST] http://localhost:8080/addCustomer { "firstName" : "karthik", "lastName" : "srinivasan", "zipcode" : "01010" }
[Should return] {"firstName":"karthik","lastName":"srinivasan","city":"New York","country":"USA","zipcode":"01010"}
*/
</pre>
