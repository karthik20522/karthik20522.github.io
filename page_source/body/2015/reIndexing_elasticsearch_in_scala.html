<h1>ReIndexing Elasticsearch in Scala</h1>

            The following scala script reads from one index and writes to another script using Scan and scroll method. The script also takes in a partial function where the values from one index
            can be manipulated before saving into another index. This script assumes you have a field called "id" and an field called "submitDate" so it can continually perform scan and scroll
            once the preliminary index copy is done, so keep the index's in sync.

<b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The ESClient is an extension of on <a href="https://github.com/gphat/wabisabi">wabisabi</a> Library for elasticsearch</li>
    <li>The Actor initially performs a scan-scroll with submit date gte 1900</li>
    <li>Once the initial scan-scroll is done, it pauses for a minute and performs a scan-scroll again with the submitDate of previous endTime (dateTime.now minus 1 minute)</li>
    <li>This way every minute after the previous run it will continually keep the index in sync</li>
    <li>The partial function "processData" provides a way to manipulate the original data, manipulate it and save it to the new index</li>
    <li>Bulk-indexing is used for saving to the new index, hence a the "id" field is required to determine the "id" of the new document</li>
</ul>
